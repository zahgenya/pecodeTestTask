# My solution for the facebook like api

It has login POST endpoint for loging in existing accout, POST register endpoint to register a user.
POST posts for creating a user post, and GET posts to retrieve all posts with optional limit parameter.
For user interactions we have GET for all users, and GET for user by id, also we have a GET request me for retrieving user itself through a req.user.
